# JumpCloud-QAssignment
JumpCloud QA Assignment test plan for David Harris

This project is a test plan for testing a password hashing application.

These tests are written to exercise the individual criteria that were specified in the 'Password Hashing Application Specification'.  Some of the tests could be easily combined to expedite testing, but are isolated for clarity of this exercise.  

Each endpoint was tested to confirm expected behavior and negative tests were added where applicable.  Tests were then added for any acceptance criteria that was not covered by those tests.

More tests for poorly formed requests (misspelled endpoint, invalid header and other request syntax errors) or some kind of 'fuzzing' tests could be added if the security risk was determined to be high for this application.
